# corbaserver

This project implements functionality sharing between a CORBA client and server. This functionality sharing results 
in transmission of data between the client, running on Course System, and the server, running on Roster System. The 
client initiates the request. All code was written in Java. 
The IDL-to-Java (idlj) compiler was used to compile NewStudentData.ipl. 
Compilation resulted in the NewStudentData folder and all its contents.
